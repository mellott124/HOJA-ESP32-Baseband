LED Color and Blink Guide (Updated)
=================================

Blue – Idle / Standby
---------------------
Pattern: Short blink (150 ms on, 1.25 s off)
Meaning: Controller powered but not connected.
When: Waiting for Bluetooth connection or before pairing.

Amber – Pairing / Discoverable
------------------------------
Pattern: Alternating amber blink (300 ms on, 300 ms off)
Meaning: In Bluetooth pairing / advertising mode.
When: After long SYNC press, factory reset, or startup with no stored host.

Green – Connected (Player-Linked)
---------------------------------
Pattern: Blinks green N times per cycle, where N = player number (1 – 4 typical)
Each blink = 200 ms on, 200 ms off, followed by a 1 s pause.
Meaning: Connected and actively communicating.
When: During gameplay or after auto-reconnect.

Examples:
- Player 1 → 1 blink per cycle
- Player 2 → 2 blinks
- Player 3 → 3 blinks
- Player 4 → 4 blinks

Red – Error / Bluetooth Failure
-------------------------------
Pattern: Blinking red (800 ms on, 800 ms off)
Meaning: Bluetooth error — pairing failed, authentication error, or disconnect.
When: Connection attempt fails or pairing lost.

Startup Sweep
-------------
Pattern: Red → Green → Blue (each 200 ms)
Meaning: Power-on self-test confirming controller booted normally.
When: Immediately after power-up.

Notes
-----
- There is no permanent “off” LED state.
- The controller always runs one of these four modes: IDLE, PAIRING, CONNECTED, or ERROR.
- In sleep mode, LED behavior depends on firmware power management state.
